Shuffle spotify playlists instead of using shuffle play

I might add a readme, who knows.

## How to
- Run the .exe
- Log in to spotify and authorize
- Follow on screen instructions
- Play music with shuffle turned off

Do note: This removes all songs from the playlist and readds them in a shuffled order... Do not stop the application before it finishes or songs will go missing. It will also reset the "Added On" date for the songs. Also, Spotify apparently has to redownload the songs for offline play, even though they were only removed for a couple seconds (However, this may only check the file system and skip over the songs that are already downloaded as it seems to download 500+ songs very quickly). Use at your own risk, I just wrote this to shuffle my playlists up and thought I might aswell release it.

## Contributing
This has been tested on 3 playlists (8 songs, 150 songs and 600 songs) with no issues. If you discover any issues, please create an issue post or contribute towards the repo to fix it.

All changes must be discussed first with an issue. Once discussed, feel free to implement. Make sure all code is well documented and runs at time of pull request.
